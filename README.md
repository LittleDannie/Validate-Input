# Validate Input
This is an attempt at putting what I learnt about regular expression to practice
It takes user input on a text/input field and matches it against the right regular Expression. If it matches there it makes the border of the text field lime #32CD32 color and if it matches wrongly it makes the text field border red and displays an error message beneath the text field.
